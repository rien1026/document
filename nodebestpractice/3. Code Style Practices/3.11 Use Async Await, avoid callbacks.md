# Use Async Await, avoid callbacks

## TL;DR:
Node 8 LTS now has full support for Async-await. This is a new way of dealing with asynchronous code which supersedes callbacks and promises. Async-await is non-blocking, and it makes asynchronous code look synchronous. The best figt you can give to your code is using async-await which provides a much more compact and familiar code syntax like try-catch

## Otherwise:
Handling async errors in callback style is probably the fastest way to hell - this style forces to check errors all over, deal with awkward code nesting and makes it difficult to reason about the code flow
