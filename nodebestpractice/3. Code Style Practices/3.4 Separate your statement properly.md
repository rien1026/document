# Separate y our statements properly
No matter if you use semicolons or not to separate your statements,<br>
knowing the common pitfalls of improper linebreaks or automatic semicolon insertion,<br>
will help you to eliminate regular syntax errors.

## TL;DR
Use ESLint to gain awareness about separation concerns. Prettier or Standardjs can automatically resolve these issues.

## Otherwise
As seen in the previous section, JavaScript's interpreter automatically adds a semicolon at the end of a statement if there isn't one,
or considers a statement as not ended where it should, which might lead to some undesired results.
You can use assignments and avoid using immediate invoked function expressions to prevent most of unexpected errors.
