# Use arrow function expressions (=>)

## TL;DR:
Though it's recommended to use async-await and avoid function parameters when dealing with older APIs t hat accept promises or callbacks - arrow functions make the code stsructure more compact and keep the lexical context of the root function (i.e. this)

## Otherwise: 
Longer code (in ES5 functions) is more prone to bugs and cumbersome to read
