# Prefer const over let. Ditch the var

## TL;DR:
Using const means that once a variable is assigned, it cannot be reassigned. Preferring const will help you to not be tempted to use the same variable for different uses, and make your code clearer. If a variable needs to be reassigned, in a for loop, for example, use let to declare it. Another important aspect of let is that a variable declared using it is only available in the block scope in which it was defined. var is function scoped, not block scoped, and shouldn't be used in ES6 now that you have const and let at your disposal
consr를 쓴다는곤 변수를 한번만 할당한다는거다, 재할당 될 수 없다. const 를 좋아하는건 같은 변수를 다른 용도로 쓰지 않게 도와준다. 그리고 그건 코드를 깔끔하게 해준다. 만약 변수가 재할당 되야한다면, for문 안에서 처럼, 
let으로 선언해 주면 된다. 

## Otherwise:
Debugging becomes way more cumbersome when following a variable that frequently changes
