# Use naming conventions for variables, constants, functions and classes
## TL;DR: <br>
Use lowerCamelCase when naming constants, variables and functions and UpperCamelCase (capital first letter as well) when naming classes. This will help you to easily distinguish between plain variables/functions, and classes that require instantiation. Use descriptive names, but try to keep them short

## Otherwise: <br>
Javascript is the only language in the world which allows invoking a constructor ("Class") directly without instantiating it first. Consequently, Classes and function0constructors are differentiated by starting with UpperCamelCase

## Code Example
```
// for class name we use UpperCamelCase
class SomeClassExample {}

// for const names we use the const keyword and lowerCamelCase
const config = {
    key: "value"
};

// for variables and functions names we use lowerCamelCase
let someVariableExample = "value";
function doSomething() {}
```
